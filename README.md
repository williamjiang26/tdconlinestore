# Goal
We want customers to have a better way to interact with our products by digitizing the process of shopping for a door. The time they spend drawing inspiration, viewing our products, learning and doing research, they are interacting with our brand and more likely to convert to our customer. We focus on providing more value in our product and in the service which we deliver the product to our customers.
