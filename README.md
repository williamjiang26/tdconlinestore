## The Problem
Scale the business's sales by building a brand and developing more customer-brand interactions and experiences through the online store (web and mobile).


## Jobs to be done
- display products to sell online
- build a brand, brand marketing
- customer support (faq, pre-sales form, tracking order, contact form)


## Broad Product Solution
We want customers to have a better way to interact with our products by digitizing the process of shopping for a door. The time they spend drawing inspiration, viewing our products, learning and doing research, they are interacting with our brand and more likely to convert to a customer. We focus on providing more value in our product and in our service through repurposing the website. The mvp will focus on getting a nicely designed, mini store for businesses to "communicate" their brand and display their products. Supports mobile view for convenience of shoppers.


## Functional Requirements

## Product Roadmap
The project is broken down to 6 parts. The landing page -> store -> product details -> cart checkout -> payment portal -> order confirmation.
