# Online Storefront
This project is a online store for home improvement businesses to easily get their products online, displayed and begin selling. Payments are handled by stripe. It also has customer support contact forms. 

# Goal
We want customers to have a better way to interact with our products by digitizing the process of shopping for a door. The time they spend drawing inspiration, viewing our products, learning and doing research, they are interacting with our brand and more likely to convert to our customer. We focus on providing more value in our product and in the service which we deliver the product to our customers. 


Revised: 

The goal for this project is to build a aesthetic and attractive online store for home improvement businesses to display their products and services and begin selling. 
The project is broken down to 6 parts. The landing page -> store -> product details -> cart checkout -> payment portal -> order confirmation. 

The mvp will focus on getting a nicely designed, mini store for businesses to "communicate" their brand and display their products. Supports mobile view for convenience of shoppers.

## The Problem
Managing a business is difficult. There are many parts to running a successful business from operations to finances and sales and what success looks like in each part is different. There is a lot of context switching and figuring out what the problems and bottlenecks are in a business. Some businesses operate like a tangled mess and owners dont know where to start. There are lots of repetitive processes for each customer's order, which is tedious to do and leads to careless mistakes. Additionally it is difficult to remember all the details about each order as well as changes made throughtout without software allowing you to easily filter and store lots of details.
