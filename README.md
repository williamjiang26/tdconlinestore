## Broad Product Solution
We want customers to have a better way to interact with our products by digitizing parts of the sales process. The time they spend drawing inspiration, viewing our products, learning and doing research, they are interacting with our brand and more likely to convert to a customer. We focus on providing more value in our product and in our service through repurposing the website. The mvp will focus on getting a nicely designed, mini store for businesses to "communicate" their brand and display their products. Supports mobile view for convenience of shoppers.
