# Online Storefront
This project is a online store for home improvement businesses to easily get their products online, displayed and begin selling. Payments are handled by stripe. It also has customer support contact forms. 

# Goal
We want customers to have a better way to interact with our products by digitizing the process of shopping for a door. The time they spend drawing inspiration, viewing our products, learning and doing research, they are interacting with our brand and more likely to convert to our customer. We focus on providing more value in our product and in the service which we deliver the product to our customers. 


Revised: 

The goal for this project is to build a aesthetic and attractive online store for home improvement businesses to display their products and services and begin selling. 
The project is broken down to 6 parts. The landing page -> store -> product details -> cart checkout -> payment portal -> order confirmation. 

The mvp will focus on getting a nicely designed, mini store for businesses to "communicate" their brand and display their products. Supports mobile view for convenience of shoppers.  

# Roadmap
The landing page -> store -> product details -> cart checkout -> payment portal -> order confirmation
