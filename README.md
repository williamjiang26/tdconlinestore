## Demo

## Introduction 
SMBs are always looking to grow their sales. They need to get new customers and their products and services onto new eyes. Consumers now use google to search for products and services and look at reviews to determine where to bring their business. Relying on word of mouth is not enough for a business to survive. What consumers value is a trustworthy brand, and a convenient and straightforward purchasing process. Trust means accessible and effective customer support and a track record from reviews of happy customers. 

## Problem
SMBs want to build their brand, show their products and services in a interesting way and demonstrate their reliability and support through a straightforward process with a history of positive reviews and available customer support. Traditional website builders are not tailored and the templates are limiting the business's personality and brand. Website builders like squarespace have advanced features like order management but you need to learn the worflow and it is not suited for nontechnical business owners leaving those features unused. You can add your own code to add custom features but at that point you are just coding the website from scratch and its not for SMB owners. 

## Broad Product Solution
SMB owners can design their 'storefront' and tailor it to represent their retail locations with easy and intuitive workflow. The mvp will focus on getting a nicely designed, mini store (storefront) for businesses to "communicate" their brand and display their products and services. Design a shopping experience that is straightforward and reviews of happy customers. Supports mobile view for convenience of shoppers. We want customers to have a better way to interact with the products by digitizing parts of the sales process. The time they spend drawing inspiration, viewing our products, learning and doing research, they are interacting with the brand and more likely to convert to a customer. We focus on providing more value in the product and in the service through repurposing website.
